<h1> I am passionate about the environment and worked at an internship called Gravity Water to help underprivileged schools get water. [This link](https://www.gravitywater.org/) will take you to their website.

<p class="custom-subtitle">I also am currently working as a supervisor behind the front desk of the Student Resource Building located at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In my free time, I love to enjoy the beautiful beaches of Santa Barbara that helps fuel my passion for the environment.</p>

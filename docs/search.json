We compared ground surface displacement of water compared to the average groundwater level. This plot found that the groundwater levels of Yolo County are continuing to overall drop below sea level. However, when comparing groundwater levels to ground surface displacement, the ground surface displacement levels are less drastic than the levels of the groundwater.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project, I collected data from UCGS. I made a chart that compared the amount of surface water and groundwater withdrawals by state to compare who withdrew the most amount of surface and ground water.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this project, I collected data from UCGS.
